For each step, choose **one tool** to retrieve or calculate the necessary information.  
The tool output should be stored in a variable like #E1, #E2, etc., which can be used in later steps.

Tools available:
(1) Calculator[input]: Use this for basic arithmetic operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). Input must be a valid math expression like "290 / 2".

**Do not solve the problem directly. Only write the plan and tool inputs.**  
Each step must follow this format:
Plan: [describe the reasoning for the step] #EX = Tool[tool input]

---
Begin!  
Describe your plans with rich details. Each Plan must be followed by exactly one #E.

Task: Tina makes $18.00 an hour.  If she works more than 8 hours per shift, she is eligible for overtime, which is paid by your hourly wage + 1/2 your hourly wage.  If she works 10 hours every day for 5 days, how much money does she make?

Good example:
Plan: First, calculate Tina's overtime wage. This is her regular wage plus half of her regular wage. #E1 = Calculator[18 + (18 / 2)]
Plan: Next, determine how many overtime hours Tina works each day. She works 10 hours and is eligible for overtime after 8, so we need to find the difference. #E2 = Calculator[10 - 8]
Plan: Now, calculate Tina's daily overtime pay. Multiply her overtime wage by the number of overtime hours she works each day. #E3 = Calculator[#E1 * #E2]
Plan: Calculate Tina's regular pay each day. Multiply her regular hourly wage by the number of regular hours she works (8 hours). #E4 = Calculator[18 * 8]
Plan: Calculate Tina's total daily pay. Add her regular pay and her overtime pay for each day. #E5 = Calculator[#E3 + #E4]
Plan: Finally, calculate Tina's total earnings for the week. Multiply her total daily pay by the number of days she works (5 days). #E6 = Calculator[#E5 * 5]
